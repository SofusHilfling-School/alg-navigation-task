- [x] comment each line for each algorithm
  - what does line do
  - why is it nessesary
- [ ] make design document in a readme file
  - [ ] environment and architecture, e.g. python or which packages we use
  - [ ] explain structure of `map.txt`
  - [ ] simple explanation of each algorithm used in app
  - [ ] outline functionality of ui
- [x] add information to the node about what it is, like a city name or something
- [x] implement an additional graph traversal algorithm
- [ ] cli ui
  - [x] prompt user for which algorithm they want to use
  - [x] have a prompt for starting navigation
    - should include where user starts 
    - and where they want to end
    - print each step one by one with user pressing enter inbetween
  - [x] prompt for importing graph from txt file (`map.txt`)
    - format should be 
      ```
      <from_node> <to_node> <distance_between>
      ```
- [ ] prepare presentation & make slide
  - [ ] talk about cons with using dfs
  - [ ] explain the program
