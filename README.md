## Architecture
We have used python as language, and we used visual studio code for writing and github for version control/code sharing.
As for architecture, we have a main file that will run every other necessary file if needed. We have a file for both 
dijktra and depth first search algorithm. Those files will be called from main if you run the program with the proper 
command i.e. "-a dijkstra" or "-a dfs" these are the commands you can use when you run main.py. We have a map.txt
that we use to define our map, and graph.py will have the functions to make it the correct structure for our graph
algorithms.
